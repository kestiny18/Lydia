# Lydia Technical Roadmap

## MVP Definition

### Goal
Within 2 weeks, using a **vertical slice** approach, implement a runnable Strategy Engine + CLI prototype.

### MVP Scope

| Included | Excluded (Future Iterations) |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Yes: Strategy Engine Core (Simplified) | No: Full Branch Management |
| Yes: CLI Client | No: Advanced Web API (Auth/WebSocket) |
| Yes: Basic MCP Integration | No: Advanced Memory (Sync/Vector) |
| Yes: Single LLM Support | No: Multi-Model Switching |
| Yes: Basic Web API (Dashboard) | No: Production-grade API |
| Yes: Local Memory (SQLite) | No: Distributed Memory |

### Success Criteria

```
User inputs task -> Lydia plans steps -> Calls tools to execute -> Returns result
```

Successfully running this complete flow constitutes MVP success.

- [x] Simple conversation call testing

#### Day 5-7: Strategy Engine v0.1
- [x] Define Task, Step, Strategy core types
- [x] Implement Intent Understanding Module (LLM Analysis)
- [x] Implement Task Planning Module (Breakdown into steps)
- [x] Implement Execution Loop (Plan -> Execute -> Observe)

### Week 2: End-to-End Connection

#### Day 8-9: MCP Integration
- [x] Integrate @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- [x] Implement MCP Client Manager
- [x] Built-in Shell Command MCP Server

#### Day 10-11: CLI Client

## Milestone Summary

| Milestone | Time | Deliverables |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **M1: MVP** | Week 2 | Runnable CLI + Strategy Engine Prototype |
| **M2: Core Refinement** | Week 4 | Strategy Versioning, Tool Ecosystem |
| **M3: Memory System** | Week 6 | Memory + Replay Validation |
| **M4: Multi-Platform** | Week 8 | Web API + Multi-Model |

## Development Principles

### Vertical Slicing
Implement the simplest version of each feature first, run through the complete flow, then iteratively improve.

```
‚ù?Wrong: Spend 1 week perfecting LLM layer, then 1 week perfecting Strategy Engine...
‚ú?Right: By Week 1, lydia run "hello" works, then iterate and optimize.
```

### Documentation Driven
- Write design docs for new features first.
- Record important decisions in ADRs.
- Update documentation synchronously with code changes.

### Continuous Availability
- Code should be runnable at the end of each day.
- Demonstrable progress every week.
