# Lydia Product Vision

## One-Line Definition

**Lydia is an intelligent personal assistant exploring the path to AGI, providing a truly smart AI companion for everyone through a powerful strategy system and scalable architecture.**

## Core Metaphor: Raising Lydia

> "We want to raise Lydia like a child. The final Lydia will be the personal assistant best suited for you, succeeding together with you."

This metaphor guides our engineering:
*   **Nature (DNA)**: The initial Strategy and Code we provide.
*   **Nurture (Parenting)**: The Safety Gates and Feedback you provide.
*   **Growth**: The Evolution Loop where Lydia learns from experience.

## Problems We Solve

### Current Pain Points

Current AI assistants face the following core issues:

1.  **Rigid Strategies**: Most AI assistants can only execute preset task flows, lacking true planning and decision-making capabilities.
2.  **Difficult to Scale**: Adding new capabilities requires extensive custom development, making it hard to adapt quickly to new scenarios.
3.  **High Barrier to Entry**: Developers need deep understanding of complex Prompt Engineering and Agent architectures.
4.  **Low Intelligence Ceiling**: Existing solutions act more like "automation scripts" than "intelligent assistants".

### Our Opportunity

AI technology is evolving rapidly, but the core problem of "how Agents make decisions" remains largely unsolved. Lydia's strategy system is designed to conquer this challenge.

## Product Vision

### Short-term Goals (Within 1 Year)

Build a **usable intelligent personal assistant prototype**:
- Basic multi-tasking capabilities.
- Pluggable strategy system framework.
- Support for common scenarios (coding assistance, information organization, task management, etc.).

### Mid-term Goals (1-3 Years)

Become the **preferred AI assistant for developers and individuals**:
- Mature strategy system capable of handling complex multi-step tasks.
- A thriving plugin/extension ecosystem.
- Industry-leading performance in specific verticals (e.g., programming assistance).

### Long-term Goals (3-5 Years)

**Explore the implementation path of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**:
- Evolve from task execution to autonomous learning and reasoning.
- Accumulate core technologies for Agent decision-making and planning.
- Contribute open-source results to AGI research.

## Non-Goals

Defining boundaries to avoid scope creep:

- **Not a General Chatbot**: Lydia focuses on "completing tasks," not "chitchat."
- **Not a Complete Vertical Solution**: We provide platform capabilities; vertical scenarios are implemented by extensions.
- **Not Chasing "All-in-One"**: Better to be perfect in core capabilities (strategy system) than mediocre at everything.
- **Not Prematurely Commercializing**: Verify technical feasibility first, then consider business models.

## Core Beliefs

> "A true intelligent assistant is not a tool that executes commands, but a partner that understands intent, plans proactively, and adapts flexibly."

We believe:
1.  **Strategy is the Soul of an Agent**: Without good decision-making capabilities, tool calls are just automation.
2.  **Extensibility Determines Longevity**: Closed systems will eventually be eliminated; only open ecosystems can evolve continuously.
3.  **AGI Requires Progressive Exploration**: Start by solving specific problems and gradually approach general intelligence.
